    <h1>Giro d'Italia</h1>

    <p class= "firstParagraph"> <!--the class = thing will define this for the CSS-->
        The Giro d'Italia is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in Italy,
         while also occasionally passing through nearby countries.[3] The first race
         was organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport;
         however it is currently run by RCS Sport.

    <h1 class="secondHeader">Le Tour de France</h1>

    <p>
        The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily
         held in France,[1] while also occasionally making passes through nearby
         countries. Like the other Grand Tours (the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España),
         it consists of 21 stages over a little more than 3 weeks.

    <h1>Vuelta a Espana</h1>

    <p>
        The Vuelta a España is an annual multi-stage bicycle race primarily held in
         Spain, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries.
         Inspired by the success of the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, 
        the race was first organized in 1935.

<!--3 ways to use CSS:

1.in-line (not best pratice, don't do it)
 -- it's where you put CSS instructions in html code.
It's inefficient because you have to write code all over the place.

2. in "head" of html code
It's more efficient than (1) because it applies to more than one thing
BUT it has to be replicated in every html page.

3. make a reference in "head" to an external CSS
    <link href="StyleSheet1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>-->
    <!--named after whatever stylesheet you created in your project 
    (create same way you create folders for images, etc, but select Style Sheet)-->
